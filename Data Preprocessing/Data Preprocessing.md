## Data-Prerocessing

In any Machine Learning process, Data Preprocessing is that step in which the data gets transformed, or Encoded, to bring it to such a state that now the machine can easily parse it. In other words, the features of the data can now be easily interpreted by the algorithm.

* Categorical : Features whose values are taken from a defined set of values. For instance, days in a week : {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday} is a category because its value is always taken from this set. Another example could be the Boolean set : {True, False}

* Numerical : Features whose values are continuous or integer-valued. They are represented by numbers and possess most of the properties of numbers. For instance, number of steps you walk in a day, or the speed at which you are driving your car at.

Data-Preprocessing usually follows the same pattern in the way to how it approaches the problem
